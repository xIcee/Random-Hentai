At the time, I had absolutely no idea how to code lua. The changes made were so insignificant and yet it took way longer than expected. I am aware that occasionally no image shows up. If someone could give advice that would be nice, but for now, you can press cross or down to just load a new one.

Uses [e621](https://e621.net) as a source.
